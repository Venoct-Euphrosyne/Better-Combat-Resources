# Better-Combat-Resources 
For Bedrock Edition!!!

Better textures for PVP in Minecraft, It shortens all swords, axes, and picks. (And shears) Turns wool to solid colors so it's easier to see, adds a low fire effect so it doesnt blind your screen, and changes the breaking texture to a progress bar you can set to be 12 different colors in the packs settings, can go in global.
