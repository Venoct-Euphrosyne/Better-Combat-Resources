# Better-Combat-Resources 
For Bedrock Edition!!!

Better textures for PVP in Minecraft, It shortens all swords, axes, and picks. (And shears) Turns wool to solid colors so it's easier to see, adds a low fire effect so it doesnt blind your screen, and changes the breaking texture to a progress bar you can set to be 12 different colors in the packs settings, can go in global.

Keep in mind this: Certain colors of the progress bars only render on certain blocks, for example the yellow one wont render well on a blue colored block. This is a Bedrock limitation as it renders the breaking texture as transparent which is not datadriven so I can't override it. White does not render at all, I kept it there so in the future if they change this the textures are there.
